# Voice-Based Academic Stress Analyzer

# Overview

The Voice-Based Academic Stress Analyzer is an innovative, AI-driven system designed to accurately assess and address academic stress among university students in Sri Lanka. The system leverages bilingual voice input recognition and natural language processing to capture the unique linguistic patterns used by students when expressing their stress levels.

By analyzing Sinhala language voice input using a 16-item self-report scale, the system can accurately predict stress levels and offer personalized recommendations to help students manage their academic stress. The system combines voice-based stress assessment, therapeutic approaches (such as music therapy and meditation), and peer support to provide a comprehensive solution for improving the well-being and academic performance of Sri Lankan university students.
